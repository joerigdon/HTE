# HTE
This repository contains files related to the manuscript "Preventing false subgroup discovery of heterogeneous treatment effects in randomized trials".  In brief the files are:
1. GenData1A.R, GenData1B.R, etc. contain all of the code to create the data sets used in the simulations presented in the paper.  **Please note** that to replicate the analysis, certain file paths may have to be changed to the four files mentioned in this README.  
2. HTE_v1.R, containing the key functions behind mCART (potentially soon to be developed into an R package)
3. SimCode1A.R, SimCode1B.R, etc. contain all of the code to analyze the simulated data sets presented in the paper.
4. TablesASD.R, contaning functions for easily making tables of absolute standardized differences to be saved in Microsoft Word

Please email Joe Rigdon at jrigdon@wakehealth.edu if you have questions about any of the files in this repository.
